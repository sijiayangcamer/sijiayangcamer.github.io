  abstract={Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter (now ‘X’) raised concerns about its governance and functioning. Using this as a case study, we propose a framework to analyze the interplay of social identities, perceptions, attitudes, and behavioral responses to major platform policy and ownership changes. Analyzing data from a two-wave nationally representative U.S. panel survey, we found that partisanship, after controlling for gender and race, was consistently associated with various perceptions about Twitter. Democrats evaluated Musk’s takeover and Donald Trump’s account reinstatement more negatively than Republicans. Moreover, we observed ‘lagging resistance,’ or a ‘wait-and-see mindset,’ among users: perceptions of negative impact, disagreement with Trump’s reinstatement, and distrust in Musk were associated with only intentions to reduce long-term Twitter use, not actual use after the takeover. Furthermore, our analysis revealed no clear differences across identity groups in platform migration, despite the tremendous attention it received after Musk’s takeover.},

  abstract={Cannabis use is rising among young adults, while their perceived risks are declining. Existing cannabis warning labels (CWLs), often dense, generic, and text-only, struggle to sustain attention or promote effective risk recognition. Drawing on construal-level theory, this study investigates whether the concreteness of textual and pictorial elements improves CWL effectiveness.This study examines how specific (vs. generic) text related to health consequences and the addition of pictograms or vivid imagery influence sustained attention to CWLs and recognition of cannabis-related health risks.In an eye-tracking experiment, 163 young adult participants were randomly assigned to view CWLs featuring: (1) generic text, (2) specific text, (3) specific text with pictogram, or (4) specific text with vivid imagery. Attention was measured via fixation duration, and recognition was assessed using a post-exposure memory test with signal detection scores.CWLs with specific text significantly outperformed generic text in sustaining attention and enhancing general risk recognition. Adding vivid imagery further enhanced attention but did not significantly improve recognition beyond specific text alone. CWLs with pictograms also led to greater attention than generic text, though less than vivid imagery, and similarly did not improve recognition.Cannabis warnings should prioritize concrete, specific text to optimize both attention and recognition. For raising awareness, incorporating vivid imagery can be beneficial. However, for educational goals centered on enhancing recognition, pictorial elements may be unnecessary if the text is sufficiently concrete. These findings offer practical guidance for designing effective warnings to curb cannabis use among young adults.Cannabis use is increasing among young adults in the United States, yet many do not fully recognize its health risks. Warning labels on cannabis products are meant to inform people about these risks, but current labels are often long, vague, and difficult to read. This study tested whether making warning messages more concrete and adding visuals could improve their effectiveness. We conducted an experiment with 163 young adults who viewed different types of cannabis warning labels while their eye movements were tracked. Some labels used generic, abstract text, while others used specific, detailed text. A subset of the specific-text warnings also included either simple pictograms or vivid images. After viewing, participants completed a memory test about the health risks shown. The results showed that labels with specific text were better than generic ones at holding attention and helping participants remember health risks. Adding vivid images drew even more attention, though they did not improve memory beyond the effect of specific text alone. These findings suggest that cannabis warnings should use clear, specific language to improve risk recognition, and vivid imagery can be added when the goal is to maximize attention.},

  abstract={Rural distrust in science, intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to concern about the ongoing uptake of pediatric vaccination. It is also unclear how to most effectively promote health behaviors within rural communities. This study was designed to explore how rural parents interpret vaccine promotion message components, including text, images, and sponsorships, and design their own messages to provide insights for public health. Rural-living parents in Wisconsin (n = 27) were recruited to participate in virtual, 90-minute focus groups/co-design sessions regarding vaccine promotion in which they were asked to evaluate the effectiveness of researcher-provided textual messages, images, and sponsorship and create final public service announcements (PSAs) with elements they believed would resonate with other rural parents. As the conceptual model guiding this work was the theory of planned behavior, our focus was on the interpretations and attitudes that participants brought to the task of creating PSAs and their perceptions of social norms in their community. Braun and Clarke’s 6-step thematic analysis was applied to qualitative data. Participants created PSAs that affirmed active parental roles in health care and emphasized local context and “relatability.” Feelings were mixed about national-level organizations. While some reported negative connotations, others recognized knowledge and competence. Participants had negative assessments of message elements that referred to rural communities as stereotypical or homogeneous. Tailoring to include local, familiar, and relatable messages, images, and sponsors that emphasize parent roles in health decision-making and the knowledge of local providers is preferred among rural parents.},

Requiring cannabis warning labels (CWLs) on social media marketing posts is a potentially cost-effective intervention to improve health education and influence online word-of-mouth, an understudied outcome in warning label science. This study combined Structural Topic Modeling, supervised machine learning, and AI-facilitated content analysis to investigate potential youth word-of-mouth responding to online edibles marketing posts that systematically varied in the presence of CWLs and social cues. Findings show that both textual and pictorial CWLs effectively reduced pro-cannabis comments, including the mentioning of sensory appeals, while increasing anti-cannabis comments among AYAs. Exogenously manipulated anti-cannabis user-generated comments had similar effects, suggesting a potential feedback loop beneficial to public health.

However, the role of care-based moral appeals within pictorial warnings (PWs), a widely implemented tobacco control strategy, remains understudied. Moreover, little is known about how smokers from diverse sociocultural backgrounds respond to the same type of care-based moral appeals, particularly in countries that have yet to adopt PWs on cigarette packaging. To address these gaps, this study reports secondary analyses of two randomized multi-message experiments using real-world tobacco control campaign messages (KUS = 319, KChina = 510) among American and Chinese smokers (NUS = 1,392, NChina = 2,306). Each participant viewed six PWs randomly selected from a large stimulus pool and rated their perceived message effectiveness, yielding 22,188 total observations. Cross-classified multilevel regression analyses revealed that smokers in both countries perceived shocking care appeals as more effective than non-shocking care appeals and other PWs that did not employ care-based moral appeals. Non-shocking care appeals were also rated more effective than the control category. Significant cross-level two-way interactions emerged between message features (shocking care appeals) and respondents’ care/harm foundation endorsement, as well as between country and care/harm foundation. The three-way interaction was non-significant. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of care-based moral appeals in tobacco control campaigns and contribute to theoretical inquiries in message effects research from global and comparative perspectives},

            While researchers often study message features like moral content in text, such as party manifestos and social media posts, their quantification remains a challenge. Conventional human coding struggles with scalability and intercoder reliability. While dictionary-based methods are cost-effective and computationally efficient, they often lack contextual sensitivity and are limited by the vocabularies developed for the original applications. In this paper, we present an approach to construct “vec-tionaries” that boost validated dictionaries with word embeddings through nonlinear optimization. By harnessing semantic relationships encoded by embeddings, vec-tionaries improve the measurement of message features from text, especially those in short format, by expanding the applicability of original vocabularies to other contexts. Importantly, a vec-tionary can produce additional metrics to capture the valence and ambivalence of a message feature beyond its strength in texts. Using moral content in tweets as a case study, we illustrate the steps to construct the moral foundations vec-tionary, showcasing its ability to process texts missed by conventional dictionaries and to produce measurements better aligned with crowdsourced human assessments. Furthermore, additional metrics from the vec-tionary unveiled unique insights that facilitated predicting downstream outcomes such as message retransmission.},

  abstract={Regardless of country, populist attitudes can better explain voting behavior and attitude formation toward social issues than party identification and political ideology. Nonetheless, despite the increased attention to rural/urban divides and diverse living experiences in each community, it has not been sufficiently uncovered how contextual factors, including local socioeconomic and health disparities, can moderate the roles of populist attitudes. Based on these findings, we explore (1) the roles of red and blue media use and populist attitudes in predicting support for preventive policies and (2) the moderation effects of local socioeconomic and health disparities in such associations. By analyzing online survey data from US adults (N = 1,700) conducted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrate that blue media use was significantly associated with preventive policy support but not moderated by any socioeconomic and health disparities examined in this research. Meanwhile, red media use was significantly moderated by the Democrat vote share. Moreover, the 2 subdimensions of populist attitudes—anti-elitism and Manichaean outlook—were significantly moderated by community-based socioeconomic disparities, namely the cumulative COVID-19 infection rates and population size change in 2016–2020. We discuss these results and highlight the significance of exploring local and international contextual factors in studying populism.},

This paper asks: Does having news literacy matter in reducing misperceptions, and importantly, for whom does having news literacy matter? Using a national survey of US adults (N = 1700) that included the largest set of COVID-19-related misperceptions examined to date (k = 84), we tested how the effects of news literacy on misperceptions vary across ideology and ideological media consumption. Although holding a higher level of news literacy is associated with fewer misperceptions in general, it helps conservatives less than it helps liberals. Moreover, although news literacy is associated with mitigating the misperception-inducing effect of ideological media consumption on both ends of the political spectrum, this potential benefit appears to be weaker for conservative media use than for liberal media use. Finally, the benefit of having news literacy is maximized among cross-cutting consumers of ideological media but dampened among like-minded consumers, particularly conservatives with heavy conservative media consumption. We discuss the implications of our findings for identifying subgroups for future news literacy interventions and understanding the potentials and challenges of using news literacy to combat misinformation in a polarized climate.},

  abstract={Objectives
To test the effects of autonomy-affirming pediatric vaccine messages for U.S. parents on overall vaccine confidence and intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 and flu while examining potential moderation effects of political ideology.
Methods
We conducted an online randomized messaging experiment with 1718 parents, balanced across political ideology (31 \% conservative, 37 \% moderate, 31 \% liberal). We compared four types of vaccine messages: 2 (autonomy-confirming vs authoritarian tone) x 2 (COVID-19 or flu). Parents viewed three messages within a single condition and rated their overall vaccine confidence and intentions to vaccinate their children.
Results
Adjusted for covariates, we found significant interactions between autonomy-confirming language and ideology. Conservative parents who saw COVID-19 messages increased vaccine confidence in response to autonomy-confirming messages, compared to both moderate and liberal parents. For flu messages, we found that autonomy-confirming messages increased confidence and intention to vaccinate for conservative parents only.
Discussion
Messages promoting pediatric COVID-19 and flu vaccination were generally more effective at increasing overall confidence toward vaccines for conservative parents when using autonomy-confirming language.
Conclusions
Pediatric vaccinations are politicalized in the United States, and messaging strategies targeting parents must consider this. Public health agencies serving conservative parents can use autonomy-confirming messaging to positively influence parents' confidence in giving their children vaccines.},

  abstract={Historically, pandemics have spurred an influx of disorganized information and escalated intergroup animosity, and COVID-19 is no exception. Pandemic reporting often features cues and testimonials to mark the distinction between “us” versus “them”; however, the influence of such journalistic practices on intergroup animosity remains largely unexplored during public health crises, let alone their potential interplay with ubiquitous user-generated comments that often accompany pandemic news stories in the digital era. We conducted an online survey experiment with a sample of U.S. participants (N = 1428) during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, systematically varying the presence of stigmatizing outgroup cues, testimonials from in-versus outgroups, and social media comments either predominantly endorsing or condemning xenophobia. Our findings reveal that stigmatizing outgroup cues amplified the effects of testimonials detailing ingroup suffering, thus heightening anti-Chinese sentiment. These results underscore the importance of evaluating the implications of journalistic practices in public health reporting on intergroup dynamics and social solidarity. Additionally, we found that online comments predominantly condemning xenophobia moderated the effects of ingroup testimonials in the direction of inducing more positive sentiments, highlighting the vital role of an engaged audience in moderating the influences of public health news coverage.},

  abstract={Background: Despite the increasing popularity of mobile health (mHealth) technologies, little is known about which types of mHealth system engagement might affect the maintenance of antiretroviral therapy among people with HIV and substance use disorders.
Objective: This study aimed to use longitudinal and detailed system logs and weekly survey data to test a mediation model, where mHealth engagement indicators were treated as predictors, substance use and confidence in HIV management were treated as joint mediators, and antiretroviral therapy adherence was treated as the outcome. We further distinguished the initiation and intensity of system engagement by mode (expression vs reception) and by communication levels (intraindividual vs dyadic vs network).
Methods: Tailored for people with HIV living with substance use disorders, the mHealth app was distributed among 208 participants aged \&gt;18 years from 2 US health clinics. Supervised by medical professionals, participants received weekly surveys through the app to report their health status and medication adherence data. System use was passively collected through the app, operationalized as transformed click-level data, aggregated weekly, and connected to survey responses with a 7-day lagged window. Using the weekly check-in record provided by participants as the unit of analysis (N=681), linear regression and structure equation models with cluster-robust SEs were used for analyses, controlling within-person autocorrelation and group-level error correlations. Racial groups were examined as moderators in the structure equation models.
Results: We found that (1) intensity, not initiation, of system use; (2) dyadic message expression and reception; and (3) network expression positively predicted medication adherence through joint mediators (substance use and confidence in HIV management). However, intraindividual reception (ie, rereading saved entries for personal motivation) negatively predicts medication adherence through joint mediators. We also found Black participants have distinct usage patterns, suggesting the need to tailor mHealth interventions for this subgroup.
Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of considering the intensity of system engagement, rather than initiation alone, when designing mHealth interventions for people with HIV and tailoring these systems to Black communities.},

Using data from a human survey, we estimated a belief network encompassing 64 topics loading on nine non-overlapping latent factors. We then seeded LLM-based agents with an opinion on one topic, and assessed the alignment of its expressed opinions on remaining test topics with corresponding human data. Role-playing based on demographic information alone did not align LLM and human opinions, but seeding the agent with a single belief greatly improved alignment for topics related in the belief network, and not for topics outside the network. These results suggest a novel path for human-LLM belief alignment in work seeking to simulate and understand patterns of belief distributions in society.},

  abstract={The spread of multimodal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) misinformation on social media poses considerable public health risks. Yet limited research has addressed the efficacy of citizen-contributed, multimodal debunking messages, especially the roles of audiovisual structural features. In a between-subject online experiment, we assessed the impacts of misleading TikTok videos promoting the false claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility and compared the effectiveness of debunking videos from medical experts vs. laypeople. We independently varied the presence of background music. Results showed that while misleading TikTok videos increased misperceptions, most debunking videos effectively countered such misinformation. Notably, compared with laypeople’s testimonial corrections, expert didactic videos benefited more from incorporating high-tempo background music, primarily through the suppression of counterarguing rather than through enhanced encoding. These findings underscore the importance to consider audiovisual structural features, such as background music, as well as the cognitive pathway through distracted counterarguing, in future research on multimodal misinformation and correction.The spread of multimodal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) misinformation on social media poses public health risks. However, we do not know much about whether citizen-contributed debunking video messages can help correct health-related misinformation, nor the roles of specific message features such as background music. To answer these questions, we conducted an online experiment where participants viewed misleading TikTok videos about COVID-19 vaccines causing infertility and then watched correction videos from experts or regular users. We also varied whether these debunking videos included high- vs. low-tempo background music. We found that most correction videos effectively corrected the false information. Notably, expert videos with fast-paced music were particularly successful in reducing counterarguments that criticized the correction messages, which in turn helped improve such correction messages’ persuasiveness. Our study underscores the importance of well-crafted multimedia corrections, including the role of background music, in combatting false information on platforms like TikTok.},

  abstract={Accurately simulating human opinion dynamics is crucial for understanding a variety of societal phenomena, including polarization and the spread of misinformation. However, the agent-based models (ABMs) commonly used for such simulations often over-simplify human behavior. We propose a new approach to simulating opinion dynamics based on populations of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our findings reveal a strong inherent bias in LLM agents towards producing accurate information, leading simulated agents to consensus in line with scientific reality. This bias limits their utility for understanding resistance to consensus views on issues like climate change. After inducing confirmation bias through prompt engineering, however, we observed opinion fragmentation in line with existing agent-based modeling and opinion dynamics research. These insights highlight the promise and limitations of LLM agents in this domain and suggest a path forward: refining LLMs with real-world discourse to better simulate the evolution of human beliefs.},

Though public enthusiasm is booming, systematic auditing of potential gender biases in AI-generated images remains scarce. We addressed this gap by examining the prevalence of two occupational gender biases (representational and presentational biases) in 15,300 DALL·E 2 images spanning 153 occupations. We assessed potential bias amplification by benchmarking against the 2021 U.S. census data and Google Images. Our findings reveal that DALL·E 2 underrepresents women in male-dominated fields while overrepresenting them in female-dominated occupations. Additionally, DALL·E 2 images tend to depict more women than men with smiles and downward-pitching heads, particularly in female-dominated (versus male-dominated) occupations. Our algorithm auditing study demonstrates more pronounced representational and presentational biases in DALL·E 2 compared to Google Images and calls for feminist interventions to curtail the potential impacts of such biased AI-generated images on the media ecology.Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like DALL·E 2 are great at turning text into creative images. Despite the fact that many people are excited about adopting this technology, not much research has been done on gender biases in the images AI generates. Our study looked at this issue by examining over 15,000 images created by DALL·E 2 that depict people in 153 different jobs. We compared these AI-generated images with job data from the 2021 U.S. census and pictures found on Google Images. We found that DALL·E 2 often underrepresents women in jobs where men are more common but overrepresents them in jobs where women are more common. Additionally, the AI tends to show more women than men with smiling faces and heads tilted down, particularly in jobs where women are more common. This could lead to misconceptions about women’s roles and abilities in these occupations. Our research found that these biases in DALL·E 2 images are more severe than those in Google Images. This highlights the need for efforts to reduce gender biases in AI so that we will not reinforce gender stereotypes and ensure fair representation of both women and men in AI-generated images.},

  abstract={Tobacco pictorial warnings could employ a variety of emotional appeals to enhance effectiveness; however, little research exists to guide the selection of discrete emotional appeals. Further, it remains unclear how contextual pro-smoking norms might influence the persuasive impacts of discrete emotional appeals within pictorial warnings, especially in China, where the overall smoking rate and social acceptance remain high. To fill these gaps, this study leveraged the largest set of pictorial warnings (K = 510) tested to date. Using a randomized large-K multiple-message design, we evaluated the impacts of disgust, fear, self-anger, contempt, shame, and hope appeals among Chinese adult male smokers (N = 2,306) on perceived message effectiveness (PME). Results showed that fear, self-anger, shame, and hope appeals significantly increased PME, while disgust and contempt appeals appeared less effective. Importantly, the PME of nearly all emotional appeals – except hope appeals – was weakened for Chinese adult male smokers with higher pro-smoking normative perceptions, highlighting the importance of considering local contextual influences when implementing pictorial warnings.},

  abstract={Despite the growing availability of effective COVID-19 vaccines in rural communities in the United States, widespread vaccine hesitancy delays COVID-19 vaccine coverage in rural communities and threatens to worsen pre-pandemic rural–urban disparities in other vaccination rates, including influenza and routine pediatric immunizations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop communication-based interventions to improve vaccine confidence in rural America. This study demonstrates the efficacy of a community-engaged approach to developing social media campaign messages in promoting COVID-19 vaccine uptake and pro-vaccine social diffusion among rural adults. Using a community-engaged approach, we developed social media campaign videos varying in (a) featured messengers (clinicians versus community leaders) and (b) the presence of personal testimonials. We conducted a national online experiment (N = 1,364 rural adults) in spring 2022. We found that videos featuring clinicians serving rural communities and their testimonials increased (a) vaccination intentions in the unvaccinated group (4-point scale, b = 0.23, p =.015) and (b) intention to discuss the messages with others (4-point scale, b = 0.14, p =.037), share the message (4-point scale, b = 0.15, p =.026), and promote the vaccines to others (9-point scale, b = 0.48, p =.013).

Yet research on the emotional basis for misinformation susceptibility and how emotional appeals may help reduce COVID-19 related misperceptions remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted a 2 (threat from COVID-19: yes vs. no) × 4 (correction conditions: none vs. factual correction vs. factual correction + words of optimistic outlook \& individual efficacy vs. factual correction + words of optimistic outlook \& collective efficacy) between-participant factorial experiment among an online sample of Chinese residents (N = 836) in June 2020. Misinformation about COVID-19 treatments and mitigation was presented in all conditions. Across five misinformation topics, threat information induced more misperceptions while all three types of corrections mitigated threat information's deleterious impact and improved belief accuracy. Importantly, corrections incorporating hope appeals showed enhanced effectiveness in improving belief accuracy when threat information was present whereas factual corrections absent hope appeals did not show similar sensitivity towards threat information. For hope appeal corrections, their indirect effects on desirable downstream behavioral intentions through corrected beliefs were stronger with than without preceding threat information. Our study thus demonstrated the potential of deploying hope appeals to fight the COVID-19 infodemic in China and beyond when threat information is prevalent, while highlighting the importance of studying the roles of emotional appeals in health misperception formation and correction.},

  abstract={The Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in Wisconsin serve the most under-resourced communities in the state and are trusted sources in local communities. Although healthcare workers can be leveraged to champion COVID-19 vaccines, existing vaccine hesitancy among the FQHC workforce itself calls for research to identify promising messaging themes that can boost their vaccine confidence. In spring 2021, through a partnership with the Wisconsin Primary Health Association, we took a community-engaged approach to develop and field a survey including 46 beliefs (Ms = 1.36–4.25, SDs = 0.81–1.46, all on 5-point Likert scales) among employees of 10 out of the 17 FQHCs in Wisconsin. In total, 347 clinical team members and 349 non-clinical staff members (a) indicated their levels of (dis)agreement with all 46 belief items and (b) reported vaccine acceptance (dichotomized, acceptance = 77.6\%) as well as recommendation intentions (dichotomized, yes = 73.9\%). We carried out the Hornik \& Woolf analyses in a multilevel logistic regression framework with bootstrapping to rank order all beliefs, segmented by subgroup and behavioral outcome. Our results suggest that communication-based interventions should promote beliefs such as those related to perceived safety and efficacy, rather than normative pressure from peers, while aiming to reduce doubts about information withholding and manipulation, the safety of the mRNA technology, the approval process, and “unnatural” ingredients in the vaccines. Subgroup-specific belief rankings are also provided. This study demonstrates the usefulness of incorporating the H\&W approach into community-engaged research with local healthcare systems to improve health messaging for vaccine promotion.},

An online sample of current smokers (N = 630) was randomly assigned to a 3 (moral frames in vaping prevention : care, purity, non-moral control) × 2 (priming of anti-smoking messages: yes or no) between-subject survey experiment. Compared with non-moral framed messages, smokers exposed to both care and purity framed messages were more likely to support vape-free policies in public places. Such effects were stronger for smokers with higher pre-treatment endorsement of the purity value, driven less by anger or disgust but more by smokers’ updating of both self-oriented and secondhand harm perceptions. Moral frames, especially those appealing to care and purity moral values, are thus promising messaging strategies for vaping prevention communication campaigns in terms of increasing current smokers’ support for vape-free policies. The results also help improve our understanding of the moral roots of health policy opinions and the potential of deploying moral framing to improve message design for health campaigns.},

  abstract={Background
This study experimentally examines whether enhanced cannabis warning labels (CWLs) outperform those currently required in the U.S. in improving recall of health risks, emotional responses, and perceived message effectiveness among at-risk young adults.
Method
We conducted an online national survey-based experiment in October 2020. Young adults aged 18–26 years old and at-risk for cannabis use (N = 523) were randomly assigned in an online experiment, to view either currently required CWLs in California with small font and a composite health risk statement, or enhanced single-theme CWLs with varying textual and pictorial components. We performed linear regression analyses to compare the enhanced with existing CWLs on information recall, negative emotions, and perceived message effectiveness. Furthermore, information recall and negative emotions were examined as parallel mediators to better understand the mechanisms underlying effective textual and pictorial enhancement of CWLs.
Results
Compared with currently required CWLs in California, both textually (b = 0.30, p = .011) and pictorially (b = 0.59, p < .001) enhanced CWLs increased recall accuracy. Pictorially enhanced CWLs outperformed their text-only counterparts (b = 0.28, p = .019) in improving information recall. Only pictorially enhanced CWLs improved perceived message effectiveness (b = 0.31, p = .008), which was mediated by negative emotions but not by information recall.
Conclusions
Given rapid expansion of the cannabis industry and declining perception of harm, currently required CWLs in the U.S. such as California’s, would benefit from redesign to improve public understanding of health risks and to prevent youth use.},

Leveraging a large collection of both tweets (N = 1,657,551) and news stories (N = 50,356) about the early COVID-19 pandemic, we employed bot detection techniques, structural topic modeling, and time series analysis to characterize the temporal associations between the topics Twitter bots tend to amplify and subsequent news coverage across the partisan spectrum. We found that bots represented 8.98\% of total accounts, selectively promoted certain topics and predicted coverage aligned with partisan narratives. Our macro-level longitudinal description highlights the role of bots as algorithmic communicators and invites future research to explain micro-level causal mechanisms.},

  abstract={Insufficient scientific evidence about electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has led to conflicting recommendations (CRs) by credible scientific organizations, creating a public health debate that could prove especially difficult to reconcile as current and former smokers make decisions about whether to use e-cigarettes. To investigate how CRs about e-cigarettes may affect intentions to engage in healthy behaviors, 717 former and current smokers were randomly exposed to one of five conditions (varying in the level of conflict in recommendations) in this between-subject experiment. Our results indicated a significant interaction between the message level of conflict and individuals’ information avoidance, employed to maintain hope and deniability. These results suggest the effects of CRs stemming from scientific uncertainty vary with subgroups of people, pointing to several pressing theoretical and practical implications.},

  abstract={Graphic cigarette warnings increase quit attempts. Perceived message effectiveness and message avoidance are predictive of later quit attempts. We sought to examine whether randomized exposure to warning messages would inadvertently increase intentions to use alternate tobacco products while enhancing attempts to quit cigarettes. An online survey of 1392 adult smokers in the US asked participants to rate six randomly selected tobacco warnings (from a set of 319) on perceived effectiveness and avoidance intentions. These two indicators of message effectiveness were calculated at the message-level and then at the individual campaign-level to facilitate causal inference. After viewing a message campaign of six warning messages, participants indicated their intentions to use alternate tobacco products. Sixty-eight percent of participants reported some intention to use e-cigarettes and intentions to use other alternate tobacco products ranged from 31\% to 40\%. Campaigns of messages eliciting higher avoidance increased the odds of intending to use hookah (aOR: 4.32), smokeless tobacco (aOR: 4.88), and snus (aOR: 8.06), but not the intention to use electronic cigarettes. These relationships are mediated by intentions to quit smoking (all p <.05). Viewing campaigns with higher campaign-level perceived effectiveness increased the intentions to quit, which in turn increased intentions to try alternate tobacco products. Our findings increase the tobacco control community’s understanding of unintended consequences of graphic tobacco warnings.},

  abstract={Objective
We sought to test whether participation in an online group including IUD users influenced IUD-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior among IUD non-users, as a proof-of-concept evaluation of information dissemination for less commonly used or novel contraceptives.
Study design
We conducted a blinded, randomized controlled trial on the effect of online communication with IUD users within an online program called Birth Control Connect. Participants were women age 18–45 living in the United States who had never used an IUD. We invited participants randomized to the intervention to join two-week, nine-member discussion groups including four satisfied IUD users and five IUD non-users; we invited control participants to groups including nine IUD non-users. We performed chi-squared tests on IUD knowledge, information-seeking, informational support and use in immediate post-surveys, and t-tests comparing change in IUD attitudes and frequency of logins to discussion groups.
Results
We invited 488 IUD non-users and enrolled them into 70 groups between October 2015 and April 2016. We found increased positive attitudes towards the IUD in the intervention arm (0.65-point increase between pre- and post-surveys, versus 0.05 mean change for control arm, p = 0.03 for hormonal IUD, with a trend in the same direction for the non-hormonal IUD). Informational support also increased, with 70.3\% of intervention arm participants self-reporting that they gained a better idea of what the IUD would be like, compared to 51.3\% in control arm (p < 0.01). Of intervention participants, 63.3\% versus 51.3\% of control participants reported gaining new information from their group (p = 0.03). There were no differences in correct responses to knowledge items or information-seeking between groups.
Conclusions
Online exposure to IUD users increased positive attitudes toward the IUD and informational support for decision-making about the IUD among non-users.
Implications statement
Online spaces provide a promising environment for the exchange of accurate, useful contraceptive information based on real user experiences. Interventions aiming to harness social communication through structured online conversations (e.g., on existing social media platforms) about user experiences with lesser-known contraceptive methods such as the IUD may be worthwhile.},

  abstract={Developing intelligent persuasive conversational agents to change people's opinions and actions for social good is the frontier in advancing the ethical development of automated dialogue systems. To do so, the first step is to understand the intricate organization of strategic disclosures and appeals employed in human persuasion conversations. We designed an online persuasion task where one participant was asked to persuade the other to donate to a specific charity. We collected a large dataset with 1,017 dialogues and annotated emerging persuasion strategies from a subset. Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus. Furthermore, to develop an understanding of personalized persuasion processes, we analyzed the relationships between individuals' demographic and psychological backgrounds including personality, morality, value systems, and their willingness for donation. Then, we analyzed which types of persuasion strategies led to a greater amount of donation depending on the individuals' personal backgrounds. This work lays the ground for developing a personalized persuasive dialogue system.},

  abstract={Background Previous research shows that pictorial warning messages (PWMs) for tobacco cigarettes increase quit attempts and smoking-related knowledge. However, few studies have investigated what specific features within PWMs are most effective. The current study sought to examine the specific features of PWMs associated with effectiveness using four outcome measures as indicators.
Method A sample of n=319 PWMs was collected and underwent systematic content analysis on 48 different content features. A sample of n=1392 current smokers each rated a subset of the labels on perceived effectiveness, negative emotional engagement, intentions to enact avoidance behaviours and intentions to forego a cigarette. Multilevel random-effects models were fitted with all coded content features and each of the outcome measures.
Results Analysis across all four outcome measures shows that PWMs depicting diseased and damaged body parts and employing a testimonial format were most effective. Additional mediation analysis showed that image-level negative emotionality partially mediated the relationship between PWM features and perceived effectiveness.
Conclusion The effectiveness of graphic imagery, testimonials and images that elicit negative emotions provides guidance for researchers as well as for future implementation of more effective PWMs.},

In an experiment on a sample of former and current smokers (N = 991), we manipulated the presence of visual vaping cues within electronic cigarette video advertisements (N = 25) to evaluate opinions towards vape-free policies. Such cues diminished the effects of pro-vaping arguments to increase support for vape-free policies, inadvertently benefiting public health. Consistent with the moral foundations theory (MFT), endorsement of the care/harm moral foundation strengthened message effects. Furthermore, cognitions and emotions related to moral intuitions mediated the effects of visual vaping cues. These findings suggest that MFT can help explain unintended effects of visual cues when outcomes are related to morality.},

  abstract={Objectives: Vaping portrayals in e-cigarette advertising are currently not regulated. This study experimentally tests two hypotheses regarding visual vaping cues in e-cigarette video advertisements on harm perceptions immediately post-exposure (T1) and 2 weeks later (T2). The cognitive gateway hypothesis predicts that vaping cues will reduce vaping harm perceptions among e-cigarette users at T1, leading to lowered smoking harm perceptions at T2. In contrast, the cognitive roadblock hypothesis predicts that vaping cues will heighten smoking harm perceptions among smokers at T1, leading to increased vaping harm perceptions at T2. Methods: A 2-wave online experiment was conducted among 251 smokers or e-cigarette users recruited from students enrolled at a large Midwestern university in 2016. Participants were randomized to view either 1) 5 e-cigarette ads containing vaping cues, 2) 5 e-cigarette ads without vaping cues, or 3) 5 bottled drink ads. Results: Findings support the cognitive roadblock hypothesis but not the gateway hypothesis. For current smokers, mediating effects of smoking harm perceptions at T1 were supported. Conclusions: E-cigarette advertisements with vaping portrayals can increase smokers’ vaping harm perceptions by activating smoking harm perceptions, potentially deterring smokers from switching to a less harmful product.},

  abstract={To identify what features of online social networks can increase physical activity, we conducted a 4-arm randomized controlled trial in 2014 in Philadelphia, PA. Students (n=790, mean age=25.2) at an university were randomly assigned to one of four conditions composed of either supportive or competitive relationships and either with individual or team incentives for attending exercise classes. The social comparison condition placed participants into 6-person competitive networks with individual incentives. The social support condition placed participants into 6-person teams with team incentives. The combined condition with both supportive and competitive relationships placed participants into 6-person teams, where participants could compare their team's performance to 5 other teams' performances. The control condition only allowed participants to attend classes with individual incentives. Rewards were based on the total number of classes attended by an individual, or the average number of classes attended by the members of a team. The outcome was the number of classes that participants attended. Data were analyzed using multilevel models in 2014. The mean attendance numbers per week were 35.7, 38.5, 20.3, and 16.8 in the social comparison, the combined, the control, and the social support conditions. Attendance numbers were 90\% higher in the social comparison and the combined conditions (mean=1.9, SE=0.2) in contrast to the two conditions without comparison (mean=1.0, SE=0.2) (p=0.003). Social comparison was more effective for increasing physical activity than social support and its effects did not depend on individual or team incentives.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: To identify what features of social media - promotional messaging or peer networks - can increase physical activity.
METHOD: A 13-week social media-based exercise program was conducted at a large Northeastern university in Philadelphia, PA. In a randomized controlled trial, 217 graduate students from the University were randomized to three conditions: a control condition with a basic online program for enrolling in weekly exercise classes led by instructors of the University for 13 weeks, a media condition that supplemented the basic program with weekly online promotional media messages that encourage physical activity, and a social condition that replaced the media content with an online network of four to six anonymous peers composed of other participants of the program, in which each participant was able to see their peers' progress in enrolling in classes. The primary outcome was the number of enrollments in exercise classes, and the secondary outcomes were self-reported physical activities. Data were collected in 2014.
RESULTS: Participants enrolled in 5.5 classes on average. Compared with enrollment in the control condition (mean = 4.5), promotional messages moderately increased enrollment (mean = 5.7, p = 0.08), while anonymous social networks significantly increased enrollment (mean = 6.3, p = 0.02). By the end of the program, participants in the social condition reported exercising moderately for an additional 1.6 days each week compared with the baseline, which was significantly more than an additional 0.8 days in the control condition.
CONCLUSION: Social influence from anonymous online peers was more successful than promotional messages for improving physical activity.

This article explores approaches to the development of a “recommendation system” for archives of public health messages. Recommendation systems are algorithms operating on dense data involving both individual preferences and objective message features. Their goal is to predict ratings for items (i.e., messages) not previously seen by the user on content similarity, prior preference patterns, or their combination. Standard approaches to message testing and research, while making progress, suffer from very slow accumulation of knowledge. This article seeks to leapfrog conventional models of message research, taking advantage of modeling developments in recommendation systems from the commercial arena. After sketching key components in developing recommendation algorithms, this article concludes with reflections on the implications of these approaches in both theory development and application.},

  abstract={This study used primary socialization theory and a focus theory of normative conduct to examine whether anti-substance-use norms mediated targeted parent–child communication against substance (alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana) use’s effects on Latino and European American early adolescents’ intentions to intervene in a friend’s substance use. Further, this study investigated whether familism interacted with targeted parent–child communication to predict anti-substance-use norms, and whether this mediated moderation model functioned differently for Latino and European American early adolescents. Self-reported longitudinal survey data were collected from 6th-8th grade students (N = 627), attending rural IL public schools. Multigroup mediated moderation analyses revealed that as Latino and European American early adolescents engaged in targeted mother–child communication against substance use, they were more likely to develop anti-substance-use parent injunctive norms, and in turn, more likely to report anti-substance-use personal norms. Thus, they were more likely to report that if their friend used substances, they would talk to their friend, seek help from others, and end the friendship. They were, however, less likely to ignore the friend’s substance use. Familism was not a significant moderator, and the hypothesized effects did not differ for Latino and European American early adolescents. The results suggest that parents of Latino and European American adolescents may discourage substance use by engaging in targeted parent–child communication, which may indirectly benefit their children’s friends, as well.},
