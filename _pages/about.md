## What we do

CAMER studies **moralization as a communicative process** and **how persuasion operates in contemporary, algorithmically mediated information environments**, translating insights from both lines of work into **real-world communication interventions** that address public-interest challenges such as **public health, climate change, and misinformation**.

## Research Areas

### Communication of Morality
This line of research examines how morality is expressed, negotiated, and transmitted through communication across hybrid media environments. It develops computational tools to track moral appeals, experimentally test their effects, and advances theory on when, why, and for whom attitudes become moralized, as well as how moralization shapes persuasion, policy support, and public discourse.

### Artificial Influence
This line of research investigates how artificial systems—including algorithms, recommender systems, and generative AI—reshape influence, persuasion, and information flows in the contemporary hybrid media ecology. It examines computational persuasion in human–AI interactions alongside emergent influence processes such as algorithmic amplification, annotation, generation, and simulation that affect individual behavior, community well-being, and public policy.

### Translational Communication Interventions
This line of research develops and evaluates communication interventions that translate insights from persuasion and message-effects research into practical policy, regulatory, platform, and community contexts, addressing public-interest challenges such as public health, climate change, and misinformation. Often implemented through social media, mobile technologies, and emerging communication systems such as generative AI, these interventions are designed to operate under real-world constraints and to inform practice, improve policymaking, and support decision-making and behavioral change, particularly in underserved communities.
